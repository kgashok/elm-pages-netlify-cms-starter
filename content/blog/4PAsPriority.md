# 4P must be the Priority

*Character and Intelligence are two main objectives of education. If I had to choose between either one of them, I would go with character, any day.*

- "If you had all the money in the world, all the time in the world, what is the first thing you would do?" 
- "If you had only 30minutes to live, what is the only thing you will do?"
- "If you were a college/ school administrator and had exhausted your annual budget,  but was given an extra USD XXX per faculty or student, what would be your priority area that you would choose to spend it on?"

My answer: **"Make them Learn Problem Solving by Programming in Python on the Pi"**
  
  - Among other things, Python has the best programming language community out there. 
  - Python has immense potential as the first language of learning programming. And also opens the door to the most sexiest job of the future (data science). 
  - High quality interactive online free books, and downloadable 
  - free online MOOC courses (Udacity, Coursera)
  - [Adaptive Learning and CER](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cYGjgLCNwg-glKjwoPfHHzQpa3T9rFb1dZHMkxPNeWw/present?slide=id.i0) - personalized feedback is critical for problem solving to achieve the 2 sigma Benjamin Bloom phenomenon 
  - Programming requires persistent practice - and requires a low cost machine at home
